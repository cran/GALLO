GALLO v1.4

- A new method to split the extra_info column from gff of Animal QTLdb was implemented. Therefore, the output of QTL annotation contains all the fields available in the extra_info column.

- The bug present was the end coordinates were bigger than the start coordinate was fixed. Now, GALLO automatically chack for these patterns ans switch the coordinates.

- A new function to estimate gene-level p-values was implemented using Weighted Z-score approach and Meta-analysis with LD correlation coefficients approaches

- A new function to estimate the number of independent markers using an adaptation of the simpleM method was implemented

- A new function to estimate the number of independent segments per chromosome based on the effective population size was implemented

- A new function to compute multi-trait test statistic for pleiotropic effects using summary statistics from association tests was implemented

- A new function to represent the association between two group of variables in a dynamic network was implemented

- A new function to compute the centrality metrics for the nodes composing the network generated by the NetVis function was implemented


GALLO v1.3

- The bug resulting in the switch between the values in the column breed was fixed

GALLO v1.2

In this version the following updates were included:

- The bug resulting in the switch between the values in the columns Flank_markers and breed was fixed

- The proper citation for GALLO now can be obtained using the command citation("GALLO"")

GALLO v1.1

In this version the following updates were included:

- Inclusion of a match.arg function for the marker argument in the find_genes_qtls_around_markers function.

- The code to allow multithreading was updated in order to allow the user to choose one (1) thread as input.

- The inclusion of the argument horiz in the plot_qtl_info() function, which allow the user to choose if the legend will be plotted vertically or horizontally.

- Changes in the legend and plot area in the QTLentich_plot function in order to better address cases where the there is a large difference between the minimum and maximum number of QTLs annotated.
